## Unfixed Bugs

- Html Validation

    ![screenshot](documentation/html_validation/signup_htmlvalid.png)

    - Couldnt find it to fix it but came clear it was signup template so I couldnt change it

- Python

    ![screenshot](documentation/python_validation/chat_setting_py.png)

    - Most of the line are too long, with others I have no issue solving it but I felt that i should leave it as it's because it's a setting.

- JS

    ![screenshot](documentation/others/jshint.png)

    - I couldnt figure it out as it was working
